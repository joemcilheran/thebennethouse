# thebennethouse
This is  a business site for a fictitious haunted hotel named The Bennet House. I created it using Html5, CSS, and JavaScript with JQuery. 
It was made as a four day project during my first week learning JavaScript, and the site features a few custom JavaScript functions that 
utilize JQuery functionality.
